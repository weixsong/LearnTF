# LearnTF
Learn TensorFlow root repo. This repo contains several TensorFlow examples & tutorials collected from github.

## TensorFlow-Examples
[TensorFlow-Examples](https://github.com/weixsong/LearnTF/tree/master/TensorFlow-Examples) cloned from [TensorFlow-Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).

Original repo of TensorFlow-Examples is [TensorFlow-Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples).

### Train Network on Multiple GPUs
I add example of how to train a network on multiple GPU cards: [Convolution Network On Multiple GPUs](./TensorFlow-Examples/examples/5_MultiGPU/convolution_network_multigpu.py)

## TensorFlow-Tutorials
Actually I think this tutorials is not as good as the first one, neither from the coding style nor the network construction.

But this tutorials has GAN network for learning, except GAN, most of the tutorials are the same as the firt tutorials.

## Next One?
